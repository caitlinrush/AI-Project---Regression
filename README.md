By: Caitlin Rush ~ 991534296

This project is exploring the task of regression using the Wine Quality Data Set [1], specifically white wine data, with the target of ‘alcohol’. The wine is from the Vinho Verde Region in Portugal. From importing the dataset to creating and tuning the models, the best models are further inspected and used to predict on new data.
